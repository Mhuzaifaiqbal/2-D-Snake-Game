This is a modern take on the classic Snake game, built using C++ and SFML. It includes:
A skin system (for snake, food, walls, bombs, explosions)
A fully functional in-game coin store
3 difficulty levels, including HARD mode with timed bombers
Persistent save data (coins, unlocked skins, high score)
A dynamic menu and game over screen
Cool explosion animations and sound-ready structure
Modular, OOP-based design with future extensibility 

Features

Game Modes
Easy – Slow speed, no obstacles
Medium – Moderate speed
Hard – Fast-paced with bombers that explode after a timer
